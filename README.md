# face_eye_detect
Face and eye detection using HaarCascades

This program is done using OpenCV and written in python language, this mini project contains 4 files :

i. face_and_eye.avi 
-> This is a video file which was recorded during my experiment; this can be used as the reference for what your project will look like at the end.

ii. face_eye_detect.py
-> The main python program file which contains all the code which is working behind the detection; it actually uses two .xml files which returns the locations of the face from the frame and then it retrns the location for the eye. 
Each line of code is explained using comment method in python, you won't face difficulty to go through it.

iii. haarcascade_eye.xml
iv. haarcascade_frontface_default.xml
 -> These are the files in which the features where proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in back 2001.
 
 You can download this file through my repo or just go to https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades to get such haarcascade files.
